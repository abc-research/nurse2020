In this challenge, participants will create methods for recognizing 12 activities conducted by nurses in both lab and in real-life settings. 
While models created with laboratory data have high accuracy, in real world, there is more variability. When collecting data in real life, there is high chance of getting missing labels during experiments since users are busy at work.  
The main challenge is leveraging laboratory data to improve models in real-life. Training data consists of data collected in both settings, but test data consists of data only from the real field (same users as training data).
